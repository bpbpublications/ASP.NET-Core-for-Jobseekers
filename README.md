## About the Book
ASP.NET Core for JobSeekers is a practical resource for application developers and web developers who want to advance their careers. This book teaches you how to use ASP.NET Core to create web applications without a prior understanding of web application development.

We develop our first web application and demonstrate how to execute, debug, and deploy them using ASP.NET Core. We'll start by creating our first web pages with the Razor and then create a simple phonebook application. Next, you will be exposed to the MVC design pattern and explore the simplicity of developing web pages using Razor. Moving on,  you learn to construct and consume restful services with ASP.NET Core. Concepts and techniques include async/await pattern, middlewares, programming a pipeline, redirecting requests, and intercepting requests and responses. This book also houses dependency injection techniques, action filters, accessing data using Entity Framework Core, and proven approaches for creating databases.

Toward the end, you'll learn about some of the most important components, such as improving performance, choosing the right architecture for an application program, and answering a slew of interview questions about ASP.NET Core and application development.
